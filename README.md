# CDMA SIGNAL TRANSMITTION
 Transmit 2 signal over one channel with encoding and retrieve the signal by decoding
 Enter the data 1 and data 2 in integer format without spaces Eg - 1234 and 5678.
 Ensure the length of data 1 and data 2 is same.
 The function encodes them and sends them ( EG- in our case we have data 1- 1234 and data 2 - 5678 , so instead of frequency and time division multiplexing it converts the encoded signal into 4 bit data only, and sends it which later can be decoded easily using the dot product.
